- How **NOT** to write the start of your repo 
- How an amateur with confidence codes 
- How stats can be fun for many reasons not just that if you know everything you can always be right
  - (How to use stats to always be right) 

here is the link to my [uni profile](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/jlaw652) although you won't find anything useful on it

# What I want to learn 
I have been **REALLY** enjoying this course and soon I hope I will be able to scrape the [Super Rugby website](https://super.rugby/superrugby/competition-stats/) because it is getting really time consuming

#**My ULTIMATE SUPER BULLETPROOF PLAN**
Past this paper I have a very bulletproof plan to become the best sports Data Anaylst out there:

- Step 1: Pass this year and keep doing club rugby data
- Step 2: Get an internship/job at a sports regional department off my pervious skills and degree
- Step 3: Get an job for a Tier 1 sports team, hone my skills for what is needed best
- Step 4: Work for the All Blacks and get paid 35k but I get free tickets and can brag that I had a say in selecting players to my family

- If Any fail return to Step 2
